## MUX Custom Device ##

**MUX Custom Device** allows users to use NI Switch relay devices inside NI VeriStand with the ability to MUX (or group) relays. These are commonly used to switch power and ground, but could be used to switch anything through a relay. The custom device was forked from the NI-Switch-Relay custom device.
